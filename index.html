    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>Scrabble is a popular word game where players use letter tiles to form words on a 15x15 board. Each letter has a specific point value, and players score points based on the words they create and the bonus squares they cover. The game ends when all tiles are used or no valid moves can be made. The player with the highest score wins.</p>

        <button class="collapsible">2. Starting the Game</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The first player must place a word using the center square, which is marked with a star. Words must be at least two letters long.</p>
            <div class="example">
                Example: If the first player plays the word "CAT", the letter "A" must be on the center star.

        <button class="collapsible">3. Taking Turns</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Players take turns forming words horizontally or vertically. Each word must connect to an existing word.</p>
            <div class="example">
                Example: If "CAT" is already on the board, you can add "S" to form "CATS".
            </div>
        </div>

        <button class="collapsible">4. Drawing Tiles</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After each turn, players draw tiles from the tile bag to ensure they have 7 tiles. If no tiles remain, continue playing with the remaining tiles.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="collapsible">5. Scoring System</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Players earn points by adding the values of each letter in their word, plus any bonuses from premium squares.</p>
            <div class="example">
                Example: If you place "DOG" with "D" on a double-letter score (DL) and "O" on a triple-word score (TW):
                <ul>
                    <li>D (2 points) becomes 4 points (double-letter score).</li>
                    <li>O (1 point), G (2 points), total = 4 + 1 + 2 = 7 points.</li>
                    <li>The word score is tripled: 7 x 3 = 21 points.</li>
                </ul>
