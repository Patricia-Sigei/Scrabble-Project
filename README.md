# Scrabble Project 

## Overview
This Scrabble project is a digital implementation of the classic word game, Scrabble. Players create words on a board using letter tiles, aiming to score the highest number of points by forming words strategically and taking advantage of double and triple letter/word score tiles. 

## Features
- Board & Tile System: The game includes a 15x15 board with letter tiles that can be placed to form words.
- Scoring System: Each letter has a point value, and special tiles like double and triple word/letter scores increase points.
- User Interface: A graphical interface for easy tile placement and game interaction. 

## Installation 

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Patricia-Sigei/Scrabble-Project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd scrabble
   ```
3. Open the index.html file in your browser and play 

## How to Play
1. Each player receives a set of 7 letter tiles at the start of the game.
2. Players take turns placing tiles on the board to form words.
3. Words must be valid and connected to existing words on the board.
4. Points are awarded based on the value of the letters used and any special tiles (double/triple letter/word scores) they land on.
5. The game ends when all tiles are used, and no further words can be formed. The player with the highest score wins. 

## Rules
- Words can only be formed horizontally or vertically.
- Words must connect to existing tiles on the board.
- Blank tiles can be used as any letter but carry no point value.
- All words are checked against the Scrabble dictionary for validity.
